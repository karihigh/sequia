# Final Abstract

The Atlas of the Forgotten Chile is a visualization of some the thousands isolated rural and indigenous communities of Chile.

According to the 2017 census, 12.2% of the chilean population live in rural areas (2,144,028 inhabitants aproximately), a population that is usually postponed by the public services and development. Many of these hamlets correspond to peasant and indigenous communities that have lived for years in the same land.

In a context of Chile that has experienced its biggest social revolt in the last 30 years, that implied a revision of the social and political identity of the country, takes special relevance to acknowledge who are those people that construct the cultural soul of a nation in tension, mainly built in the big cities. The Atlas of the Forgotten Chile attempts to reveal and highlight all those small and forgotten communities that have no power at all, those not considered by government decisions because most of them don't even exist in maps. Those smalls communities are the aesthetics of a Chile who nobody cares about, even the forces of change that fight for a better country.

This project was developed by Guillermo Montecinos as a final project for the class "All Maps Lie" taught by Joey K. Lee.

The Atlas of the Forgotten Chile is an interactive visualization of the isolated rural and indigenous communities of Chile.

In the context of a country that has experienced its biggest social revolt in the last 30 years, that implied a revision of its social and political identity, it takes special relevance to acknowledge who are those people that construct the cultural soul of a nation in tension, mainly built in the big cities. The atlas attempts to reveal and highlight all those small and forgotten communities –most of them peasant and indigenous– that conform the aesthetics of a Chile who nobody cares about.

This beta version contains 142 communities from the regions of Arica y Parinacota, and Tarapacá, in the northern Chile. The geospatial data of each community was taken from the Chilean Settlements dataset, an unofficial database that contains all Chilean settlementes. 

For each of the first 500 entries of the database, a screenshot of the settlement was scraped from Google Maps, at a height of 1,300 m. Afterwards, all the images that didn't contain a community –which means, the entries whose data was wrong– were cleaned, getting to the final dataset of 142 communities. Then, the data was mapped using Leaflet and an interaction was stablished between the visual dataset and the map, that highlights the settlement in the map when it is hovered on the grid.

This work was inspired by the Pocket Atlas of Remote islands, by Judith Schalansky and the projects OpenAerialMap and Missing Maps.

The next steps of this project is to include more isolated communities, and explore new interactions that allow move the map following the grid's movement.
